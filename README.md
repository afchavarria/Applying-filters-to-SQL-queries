# Applying-filters-to-SQL-queries

##Project description
My team was charged with obtaining specific data from employees to analyze any potential security issues and to update computers. This task was done by filtering the required information from the database. First, we filtered to find all failed login attempts after business hours, login attempts on specific dates, and logins that didn't originate in Mexico. We retrieve information about certain employees in the Marketing department, information about employees in the Finance or the Sales department and information about employees who are not in the Information Technology department.

##Summary
In all, I was able to obtain specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they belong to from the database to investigate potential security issues and to update computers. By filtering with AND, OR, and, NOT, I was able to obtain the required information from the database.
